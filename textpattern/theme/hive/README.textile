h1. Hive admin-side theme for Textpattern CMS

*Please note 1:* You'll need to be using the "latest SVN releases of Textpattern":http://code.google.com/p/textpattern/ in order to use this admin theme - we have done extensive work on improving the Textpattern admin-side code structure since v4.5 which directly relates to features used within this theme.

*Please note 2:* This theme is currently under development, and as such parts of the code are probably unfinished/unformated/untested/broken - please check the "GitHub project":https://github.com/philwareham/txp-hive-admin-theme/commits/master regularly for the latest revisions.

You are free to modify this theme, reuse code herein, and distribute all its supporting files as long as licences are respected (see below).

h2. Installation instructions

# Upload the directory 'hive' into your Textpattern installation -> theme directory.
# Log in to your Textpattern admin area. Navigate to admin -> preferences -> advanced.
# Select 'Hive' from the 'Admin-side theme' dropdown list. Save the preferences.
# You can also install the theme easily using the "smd_admin_themes":http://stefdawson.com/sw/plugins/smd_admin_themes plugin.
